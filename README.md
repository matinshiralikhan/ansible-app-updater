# Ansible Project: Update and Patch Application

This Ansible project is designed to automate the process of updating and patching an application on a remote server. It involves copying a file to a remote server, executing a patch update via a curl command, and verifying the success of the update by checking a log file. The project follows best practices by using roles, handlers, and modular task files for better organization and maintainability.

### File Descriptions

#### 1. `ansible.cfg`
This is the configuration file for Ansible. It sets default values for various Ansible options to simplify running Ansible commands. For example, it specifies the inventory file location and disables host key checking.

```ini
[defaults]
inventory = hosts
remote_user = root
host_key_checking = False
```

#### 2. `hosts`
The inventory file lists the servers managed by Ansible. In this example, it includes a group called `webservers` with one server.

```ini
[webservers]
10.10.10.214 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

#### 3. `var.yml`
This YAML file contains variables used in the playbook. In this case, it defines the name of the file to be updated.

```yaml
---
file_to_update: 20.1.2-to-20.1.3.tar.gz.enc
```

#### 4. `playbook.yml`
The main playbook that applies the `update_and_patch` role to the hosts defined in the inventory file. It also includes the variable file `var.yml`.

```yaml
---
- name: Update and patch application
  hosts: webservers
  vars_files:
    - var.yml
  roles:
    - update_and_patch
```

### Role: `update_and_patch`

Roles in Ansible are a way to group tasks, handlers, and variables. This project uses a role named `update_and_patch` to encapsulate all tasks related to updating and patching the application.

#### `roles/update_and_patch/tasks/main.yml`
The main task file for the role, which includes other task files for better modularity.

```yaml
---
- name: Copy the file to the remote server
  include_tasks: copy_to_remote.yml

- name: Copy file from remote server to target directory
  include_tasks: copy_to_target.yml

- name: Execute the curl command
  include_tasks: execute_curl.yml

- name: Wait for 5 minutes before checking the log file
  ansible.builtin.pause:
    minutes: 5

- name: Check the log file
  include_tasks: check_log.yml

- name: Trigger restart handler if update was successful
  ansible.builtin.meta: flush_handlers
  when: log_content.stdout.endswith('Completed Update')
```

#### `roles/update_and_patch/tasks/copy_to_remote.yml`
This task copies the specified file from the local machine to the remote server's builds directory using `scp`.

```yaml
---
- name: Copy the file to the remote server
  ansible.builtin.command: >
    scp {{ file_to_update }}
    root@10.10.10.214:/var/www/abshar/bin/builds
  become: yes
  delegate_to: localhost
```

- **ansible.builtin.command**: Runs a command on the target node.
- **delegate_to**: Runs the task on a different host (in this case, localhost).

#### `roles/update_and_patch/tasks/copy_to_target.yml`
This task uses SSH to copy the file from the remote server's builds directory to the target directory on the same remote server.

```yaml
---
- name: Copy file from remote server to target directory
  ansible.builtin.command: >
    ssh root@10.10.10.214 "scp /var/www/abshar/bin/builds/{{ file_to_update }} /var/www/html/baadbaan-docker/baadbaan_new/storage/app/patches"
  become: yes
```

- **ansible.builtin.command**: Runs a command on the target node.
- **become**: Elevates privileges using `sudo` or similar.

#### `roles/update_and_patch/tasks/execute_curl.yml`
Executes a curl command on the remote server to trigger the patch update.

```yaml
---
- name: Execute the curl command
  ansible.builtin.shell: curl "http://localhost:9990/patch?version={{ file_to_update }}"
  register: curl_output
```

- **ansible.builtin.shell**: Runs a shell command on the target node.
- **register**: Captures the output of the command in a variable (`curl_output`).

#### `roles/update_and_patch/tasks/check_log.yml`
Checks the log file to ensure the update was completed successfully. It retries the check multiple times with delays.

```yaml
---
- name: Check the log file
  ansible.builtin.command: cat /var/www/html/services/update-toolbox/app.log
  register: log_content
  until: log_content.stdout.endswith('Completed Update')
  retries: 5
  delay: 10

- name: Fail if the update was not successful
  ansible.builtin.fail:
    msg: "Update did not complete successfully"
  when: not log_content.stdout.endswith('Completed Update')

- name: Success message
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: "Update completed successfully"
  when: log_content.stdout.endswith('Completed Update')
```

- **ansible.builtin.command**: Runs a command on the target node.
- **register**: Captures the output of the command in a variable (`log_content`).
- **until**: Repeats the task until the condition is met or the retries are exhausted.
- **retries**: Number of times to retry the task.
- **delay**: Delay between retries.
- **ansible.builtin.fail**: Fails the playbook execution with a message.
- **ansible.builtin.debug**: Prints a debug message.

### Handlers

Handlers are tasks that run only when triggered by a notification from other tasks.

#### `roles/update_and_patch/handlers/main.yml`
Defines handlers for this role. In this example, a handler is used to show remaining retries and restart the application service if needed.

```yaml
---
- name: Show remaining retries
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: "Remaining retries: {{ remaining_retries.retries }}"

- name: Restart application service
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: your-application-service
    state: restarted
```

- **ansible.builtin.debug**: Prints a debug message.
- **ansible.builtin.service**: Manages services (start, stop, restart, etc.).

### Usage

#### Step 1: Set up SSH Keys
Ensure you have SSH access to your remote servers by generating and copying SSH keys.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@10.10.10.214
```

#### Step 2: Update Variables
Update the `var.yml` file with the name of the file you want to update.

#### Step 3: Run the Playbook
Execute the Ansible playbook to perform the update and patch process.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

### Monitoring Progress
The playbook includes debug messages to show progress and handlers to display remaining retries.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to structure an Ansible project using roles, modular task files, and handlers to manage complex automation tasks effectively. By following these best practices, the project is more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand.
